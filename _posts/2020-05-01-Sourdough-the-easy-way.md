Like all the world it seems, access to commercial yeast is cramping break making style. 
Luckily, there are some tips to make the way easier online. 
Quick route to a working sourdough starter using commercial yeast
And good tips on making the loaf with a breadmaker!

## Using the breadmaker

Really helpful advice from [a blog here](http://www.petephillips.me.uk/blog/2018/03/sourdough-loaf-in-a-breadmaker/) for wise people using a Panasonic bread maker in particular 

To make the dough:

> 390g strong white bread flour

> 170g 50% sourdough starter

> 6g salt (1 teaspoon)

> 2tbsp olive oil

> 1tsp sugar

> 200ml cold water


Run menu 22 - pizza dough cycle
(Takes about 45 minutes).

When the dough cycle completes, set up the French bread cycle (8)

Run using timer so ready in the morning


## Starting it off:
Based on the [red star yeast online recipe](https://redstaryeast.com/recipes/sourdough-starter/)

As [Ann Leckie noted on twitter](https://twitter.com/ann_leckie/status/1255888548458369024) - using commercial yeast rather than natural ones makes it all a bit simpler


> 200g flour

> 250 ml warm water

> 1 teaspoon yeast  - I used the Allinson fast acting instant yeast

> 1 teaspoon sugar

(Easy to measure quantities - bit more starter than need really?)


dissolve yeast in warm water (about 40 C);
let stand 5 minutes. Add flour and sugar.

Stir by hand until blended. The mixture will be thick; any remaining lumps will dissolve during the fermentation process. Cover loosely with plastic wrap.

Let stand in warm place for 5 days, stirring 2 to 3 times each day. 

The starter can be used at room temperature, 
or placed in the refrigerator for later use.
