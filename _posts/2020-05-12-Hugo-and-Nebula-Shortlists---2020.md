title: Hugo and Nebula Shortlists - 2020
---


So it's an odd time around the world it lots of different ways, but Springtime brings the traditional delights of the Hugo and Nebula shortlists appearing.

Best Novels to start - and as per usual overlapping sets from the two awards,
and some good contenders didn't get shortlisted.

Of the ones I've read, *A Memory Called Empire* by Arkady Martine (Tor; Tor UK) is the best so far.

*The Ten Thousand Doors of January*, Alix E. Harrow (Redhook; Orbit UK), *Middlegame*, Seanan McGuire (Tor.com Publishing), and 
*Gideon the Ninth*, Tamsyn Muir (Tor.com Publishing)
have all been strong too.

Typically interesting discussion of the Nebula nominees coming up on [The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/) - the bootleg is out for members, and the edited version presumably will appear shortly.
