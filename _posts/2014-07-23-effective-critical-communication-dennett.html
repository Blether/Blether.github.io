<p>a quotation from Daniel Dennett has become widely found on the internet now:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The social psychologist and game theorist Anatol Rapoport (creator of the winning Tit-for-Tat strategy in Robert Axelrod’s legendary prisoner’s dilemma tournament) once promulgated a list of rules for how to write a successful critical commentary on an opponent’s work. First, he said, you must attempt to re-express your opponent’s position so clearly, vividly and fairly that your opponent says “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.” Then, you should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement), and third, you should mention anything you have learned from your opponent. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking back this seems to be inspired by <br/>
Fights, Games, and Debates by Anatol Rapoport (1960, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor) e.g. page 286-8<br/>
and the approach to debate outlined there<br/>
1. Conveying to the opponent that he has been seen and understood<br/>
2. Delineating the region of validity of the opponent&rsquo;s stand<br/>
3. Inducing the assumption of similarity</p>

<p>That text makes reference to Carl Rogers;  Rogerian argument is described in brief in<br/>
Rogers, C. R. 1951. Communication: Its Blocking and its Facilitation. (see e.g. reprint in On Becoming a Person, C. R. Rogers, 1961, 329-337, Boston: Houghton Mifflin.) or online: <a href="http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/jjohnston/English1A/readings/rhetoricandthinking/communicationitsblockingitsfacilitation.htm">http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/jjohnston/English1A/readings/rhetoricandthinking/communicationitsblockingitsfacilitation.htm</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Real communication occurs&hellip; when we listen with understanding&rdquo;<br/>
[proposed simple experiment in arguments]<br/>
&ldquo;Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker, and to that speaker&rsquo;s satisfaction&rdquo;</p>
