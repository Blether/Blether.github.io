title: BBEdit and ePub editing
---


BBEdit is an excellent tool for editing ePub files.

The ePub is one of those formats which are, under the hood, a zip archive of files.
BBEdit has had the ability to open ePub and edit the underlying files without having to manually unzip and rezip them, for some time.
Add in the Multi-file find and replace functions, and syntax checking, and it proves a powerful tool for quick changes and fixes to these e-book files.
